# Meta Hacker Cup 2022
https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup/2022

## How it works
1. Download test cases zip file (password protected)
2. Click the reveal password (this will start the 6-minute timer)
3. Unzip the test cases file with this password
4. Solve the problem: input -> output file
5. Upload the output file with the code before the time is out

## Tips
- Think of all possible edge cases
  - lowest/highest possible value
  - negative int
  - uniqueness
  - big number of input
- Try to precompute, this helps us get O(1) time for any given input
- Use goroutine to calculate the output concurrently

## How to use
- use the template-program to solve the problem

## Note
- to run the program for each problem, add the input.txt and update the path in the code accordingly
